# Python Blockchain Implementation

This is a simple blockchain implementation based on the bitcoin
whitepaper created as an educational exercise. It implements PoW
mining with block awards, person to person transactions, and
signature verification.

As this is meant as an educational project, it has quite a few
rough edges and issues, some of which are notated in the source
code.

# Usage

```
virtualenv venv -p $(which python3)
source venv/bin/activate
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
python3 run.py
```
